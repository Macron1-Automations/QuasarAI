# Step-by-Step Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Clone the repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. You can do this by using the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository. Once cloned, navigate into the repository by using the `cd` command.

### Step 2: Create a new .env file
In the repository, you will find a file named `.env.example`. Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`. You can do this by running the following command: `cp .env.example .env`.

### Step 3: Populate the .env file
Open the newly created `.env` file and fill it with the necessary keys and values. You may need to sign up for certain services to obtain these keys. The `.env.example` file includes comments with instructions on how to obtain each key.

### Step 4: Generate blueprints
Run the `rails generate blueprints` command. This will copy the blueprint files into the `blueprints` directory.

### Step 5: Modify the blueprint files
Change the `topics.yml` and `prompts.yml` files in the blueprints directory to reflect the feeds and prompts you want to use.

### Step 6: Fine-Tune story generation
In the future, you can fine-tune story generation by excluding unwanted tags in the `tunings.yml` file.

### Step 7: Update the blueprints
Once you've made your changes, execute the `rake blueprints:update` command. This will load your changes into the database.

### Step 8: Set Up the Database
After updating the blueprints, it's time to set up your database. Run the following commands to create the database and load the schema:
```bash
rails db:create
rails db:schema:load
```
